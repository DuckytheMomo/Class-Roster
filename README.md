# Class-Roster
## Project Information

This project was created with the goal of migrating existing student information onto a C++ platform. This system was made with already existing requirements such as student data for the program needing to include student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree program. This program can parse and manipulate data.
